"""§13 gate orchestration — the Survive ⊳ Preserve ⊳ Edge ⊳ Return walk (task 4.1).

Boundary: orchestrator (Requirements 2, 5, 7, 10). Source of truth:
``.kiro/specs/execution-daemon/design.md`` §"System Flows" (the per-tick sequence,
lines 174-216) + §"Control — ``orchestrator``" + the Requirements-Traceability
rows 2.x / 5.1 / 7.1 / 10.x.

What this module is
-------------------
The §13 walk against the **landed survival contract** (``src/survival/gate.py``).
On each evaluation it runs, *in this fixed order*:

  1. ``assess`` (the Survive standing-monitor) — every tick, even when blocked
     (Req 1.2 cadence is honored at this entry; the loop, task 4.4, drives the
     cadence). Returns the next op-state + de-risk directives + events.
  2. **Derive "new exposure permitted"** from the freshly-read ``OperationalState``
     — ``kill_switch`` off **and** ``safe_mode_grade`` rank below ``HALT_NEW``
     (i.e. not ``HALT_NEW`` / ``FLATTEN``). ``assess`` returns directives + an
     op-state, *not* a permit flag, so the daemon derives the branch from op-state
     (design §System-Flows "Key decisions"; Req 2.1 / 7.1).
  3. ``candidate.assemble`` → ``decide`` → ``order_builder`` → per-order ``admit``.

The walk proceeds to ``candidate``/``decide``/``order_builder`` when new exposure
is permitted **or** when a held position could be reduced/closed on this tick (the
true-exit path must always be able to get flat — Req 7.2). The **per-order
``admit`` is the enforcer**: under an engaged kill-switch it *rejects* a new open
but *short-circuits a true exit to ALLOW* (fail-toward-flat — ``gate._is_true_exit``).
So the orchestrator never itself decides "this exit may pass the kill switch"; it
constructs the order and lets ``admit`` classify it (Req 10.2/10.3 — verdicts come
from the dep, never self-computed).

The BL-3 adaptation (the Phase-2 cross-spec seam)
-------------------------------------------------
``order_builder`` returns the **daemon-owned** ``types.ProposedOrder`` (with a
``position_id`` + the broker ``Direction`` **enum**). ``survival.admit`` consumes
the **survival** ``ProposedOrder`` (``symbol``, ``intent``, ``direction:str``,
``volume``, ``stop_loss`` — **no** ``position_id``). At the admit seam the daemon
maps daemon→survival: **drops ``position_id``** (kept on the daemon order for the
broker submit, task 4.2) and projects ``direction`` enum→``.value`` str. The
other ``admit`` args are assembled here: the ``AccountState`` (broker
readouts), the fresh ``OperationalState`` (read by the loop from
``survival_gate_state``), the pinned ``SurvivalParameters`` (the survival
namespace), the ``ClockState``, and the ``OrderEvaluation`` projection (built via
``evaluation.build_order_evaluation``, task 4.5).

Resize-on-advisory (Req 3.5) — exactly one pass
-----------------------------------------------
On a ``REJECT`` carrying an ``advisory_max_volume`` (a ``size_limit`` breach), the
daemon resizes to ≤ the advisory by threading the advisory cap into a **re-build**
of ``order_builder`` (never mutating the gate's order — the gate returns an
advisory, not a resized order, ``gate._reject``), then **re-admits once**. The ATR
stop-loss is volume-independent, so the re-build reaches a fixpoint in one pass
(design §System-Flows). A persistent reject after the single resize leaves the
order **un-admitted** (never-upsize, P7 — the daemon never loops to force a fit).

Leaf-executor boundary (Req 10): this module **orchestrates and never recomputes**
a dependency value. It obtains the directional decision (``decide``), the survival
verdicts (``admit`` / ``assess``), the sizing (``order_builder`` ≤ advisory), and
the position state (``get_positions``) exclusively from their owning deps. It
imports the survival types + the daemon ``evaluation`` projection; the survival
*logic* is injected as ``admit`` (the loop wires the real ``gate.admit``), so this
stays inner-ring-testable with synthetic state + the REAL pure ``admit`` (P14).

Pure of I/O at this seam: the broker submit + the trace persist are the
**paper-lifecycle driver** (task 4.2) and the loop (task 4.4) — this module
returns a structured :class:`OrchestrationOutcome` the lifecycle driver acts on
(persist-then-act: the op-state transition from ``assess`` is surfaced for the
loop to persist *before* any submit). No MCP, no LLM (P1).

            distinct — G4), so both seams are threaded rather than re-deriving one
            from the other.
        survival_params: the pinned ``SurvivalParameters`` (survival namespace).
        clock: the ``ClockState`` (closure-imminence + session — admit ignores it,
            assess uses it).
        feed: the fast-clock ``MarketFeed`` (threaded into ``assemble``).

# Paper-mode order lifecycle driver (task 4.2 — Requirement 3).               #
# --------------------------------------------------------------------------- #
#
# Once an order clears ``admit`` (ALLOW), the daemon drives it through the
# broker's **paper-mode** submit→poll→reconcile lifecycle. This seam is
# deliberately small and pure-of-its-own-logic (Req 10): it obtains the venue
# action from ``broker.submit_decision`` and never simulates a fill itself.
#
# Four contracts (Req 3):
#
#   * **Paper-only (3.1).** The driver pins a paper ``RuntimeMode``
#     (``paper_enabled=True``) onto every ``submit_decision`` call, so the broker
#     can *never* route to its live-transmit path (``live_transmit_allowed()`` is
#     False whenever paper is on, by construction — broker ``config.RuntimeMode``).
#     There is no live branch in this module; v0.1 has no reachable live path.
#   * **submit→poll→reconcile to a terminal outcome (3.2).** ``submit_decision``
#     in paper mode returns a structured ``OrderResult`` synchronously
#     (``simulated`` / ``rejected`` / ``noop``); the driver classifies it to a
#     terminal lifecycle outcome. The poll is bounded (a slow venue surfaces
#     ``unconfirmed`` rather than stalling the single-threaded loop, Req 3.2/3.3)
#     — in paper the result is immediate, but the bounded shape is kept so the
#     same driver tolerates an ``unconfirmed`` without looping forever.
#   * **Unconfirmed surfaced, never filled (3.3).** An ``unconfirmed`` result is
#     reported AS unconfirmed; ``is_filled`` is True *only* for ``filled``.
#   * **Double-send guard (3.4).** While a submitted order's confirmation is
#     pending (an ``unconfirmed`` outcome), a re-drive for the **same order
#     intent** does NOT issue a duplicate submission — the daemon-owned
#     ``PaperSendGuard`` suppresses it (the broker's own 7.4 guard is on the
#     *live* path, unreachable in paper, so the daemon owns the paper-mode guard).
#
# This driver returns a structured :class:`PaperLifecycleOutcome` the loop
# (task 4.4) and the trace assembler (task 3.3) act on — it does not itself
# persist a trace or emit an event (those are the loop's seams; persist-then-act).


# Terminal lifecycle statuses (the broker ``OrderStatus`` union, all terminal in
# paper mode). ``filled`` is the only *confirmed fill* (Req 3.3); ``simulated`` is
# the paper confirm. ``unconfirmed`` is the only status that keeps an intent
# PENDING for the double-send guard (Req 3.4) — every other status
# (``filled`` / ``simulated`` / ``rejected`` / ``noop``) is a confirmed terminal
# that clears the pending mark.
